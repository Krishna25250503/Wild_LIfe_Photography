                <h3>Royal Bengal Tiger</h3>
                <p>Tigers are the largest members of the cat family and are renowned for their power and strength.

                    There were eight tiger subspecies at one time, but three became extinct during the 20th century.
                    Over the last 100 years, hunting and forest destruction have reduced tiger populations from hundreds
                    of thousands of animals to perhaps fewer than 2,500. Tigers are hunted as trophies, and also for
                    body parts that are used in traditional Chinese medicine. All five remaining tiger subspecies are
                    at-risk, and many protection programs are in place.</p>

                <h3>Wolf</h3>
                <p>Wolves are legendary because of their spine-tingling howl, which they use to communicate. A lone wolf
                    howls to attract the attention of his pack, while communal howls may send territorial messages from
                    one pack to another. Some howls are confrontational. Much like barking domestic dogs, wolves may
                    simply begin howling because a nearby wolf has already begun.</p>

                <h3>Lion</h3>
                <p>Lion prides can be as small as 3 or as big as 40 animals. In a pride, lions hunt prey, raise cubs,
                    and defend their territory together. In prides the females do most of the hunting and cub rearing.
                    Usually all the lionesses in the pride are related—mothers, daughters, grandmothers, and sisters.

                    Many of the females in the pride give birth at about the same time. A cub may nurse from other
                    females as well as its mother. Each pride generally will have no more than two adult males.</p>

                <h3>African Elephant </h3>
                <p>African elephants are the largest land animals on Earth. They are slightly larger than their Asian
                    cousins and can be identified by their larger ears that look somewhat like the continent of Africa.
                    (Asian elephants have smaller, rounded ears.)

                    Although they were long grouped together as one species, scientists have determined that there are
                    actually two species of African elephants—and that both are at risk of extinction. Savanna elephants
                    are larger animals that roam the plains of sub-Saharan Africa, while forest elephants are smaller
                    animals that live in the forests of Central and West Africa. The International Union for the
                    Conservation of Nature lists.</p>

                <h3>Leopard
                </h3>
                <p>Leopards are powerful big cats closely related to lions, tigers, and jaguars. They live in
                    sub-Saharan Africa, northeast Africa, Central Asia, India, and China. However, many of their
                    populations are endangered, especially outside of Africa.

                    You can identify most leopards by their light color and distinctive dark spots. Those spots are
                    called rosettes, because they resemble the shape of a rose. These patterns camouflage their bodies
                    as they move through the grass and trees. Black leopards, which appear to be almost solid in color
                    because their spots are hard to distinguish, are commonly called black panthers</p>
